# EVENT SCHEDULER

A console-based Event Scheduler where events are prioritized based on their scheduled date and time. A min-heap ensures that the earliest event is always at the top of the schedule.
# What can it do?
Add an event with a specific date and time. View the next event in the schedule. Remove the next event after completion. List all events in chronological order.
# Why did you make that kind of application and how does it contribute to you or to the community?
I created the Simple Event Scheduler to solve the common problem of managing events by priority. It was a great way to dive into heaps and see how they can efficiently organize tasks. This project helped me truly understand heaps beyond theory and appreciate their power. It was satisfying to create something simple, useful, and shareable, all while building my skills and confidence.
For the community, this app serves as both a learning tool and a practical scheduler. It demonstrates how heaps solve real problems and helps new programmers grasp key concepts. Even in its basic form, itâ€™s useful for managing events, and its simplicity makes it easy to expand with features like reminders or calendar sync.
